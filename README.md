User enter what they want on the input entry and click enter to add items. 
Here I added my `student ID` and `Name`

- Delete

## Navigating between pages 
> When an item is clicked it will navigate to the detail page where it displays the details.

<img src="/img/details.png" width="20%" height="20%"/>  <img src="/img/details 2.png" width="20%" height="20%"/>  
 
## Connectivity
> If the device is not connected to the Internet it will display an alert and user are not able to add or delete any item.

Above I tried adding `Framework Programming`, because the wifi is off, it is not able to. Instead it diplay the alert.
